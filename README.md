# Ransomware-Detector
The ransomware detection system works by continuously scanning files on a Windows machine, generating hash values for each file, and comparing them to a stored hashes. The Python script  monitors the system for any file changes, computing hashes for new or modified files, and  compares them against a pre-defined list of hashes. If a match is not found, the system identifies  the threat and sends an alert to a centralized web monitoring UI. This UI allows administrators to  manage multiple machines, displaying alerts in real-time. Users can add, update, view, or delete  machine records, ensuring that the security status of each machine is up-to-date and that  appropriate actions are taken when threats are detected.
Technologies Used: React, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, Python,Virtualbox(Windows)
The ransomware detection system will have successfully provided a robust mechanism for  real-time identification and prevention of ransomware attacks within a Windows  environment. The Python script will efficiently scan and compare file hashes, detecting  malicious files before they can cause significant harm. The integration with a centralized  web monitoring UI will allow administrators to manage multiple machines, monitor  potential threats, and take action remotely. Key achievements include the automation of  threat detection, enhanced network security, seamless communication between the  detection script and the web UI, and a user-friendly interface for managing machine  statuses. This project will ultimately contribute to a safer and more secure network  environment.
